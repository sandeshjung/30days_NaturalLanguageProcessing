# 30 Days of Natural Language Processing üöÄ

Welcome to my 30-Day Natural Language Processing (NLP) Challenge repository! This project documents my journey of learning and exploring various NLP concepts and techniques over 30 days. Each day focuses on a specific topic, complete with code examples (primarily in Jupyter Notebooks), explanations, and practical implementations.

**The goal of this 30-day challenge is to:**
*   Systematically learn fundamental and some advanced NLP concepts.
*   Gain hands-on experience with popular NLP libraries and tools.
*   Build a portfolio of small NLP projects and code snippets.
*   Share my learning process and insights.

**Each `Day_XX` folder typically contains:**
*   A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with the code, explanations, and tasks for that day.
*   Any necessary data files (e.g., `.csv`, `.txt`).
*   Optionally, a `README.md` with a summary or specific instructions for the day.

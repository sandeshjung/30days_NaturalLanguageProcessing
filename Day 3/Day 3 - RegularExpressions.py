T9 system is used for entering text on mobile phones. Two or more words that are entered with the same
sequence of keystrokes are called textonyms.
eg. hole and golf both are entered by pressing sequence 4653.

function nltk.regexp_tokenize() is similar to re.findall(). 
however, nltk.regexp_tokenize() is more efficient for this task, and avoids the need for special treatment of parantheses.

Word segmentation:
    For some writing systems, tokenizing text is made more difficult by the fact that there is no visual representation of word boundaries. 
    For example, in Chinese, the three-character string: 爱国人 (ai4 "love" (verb), guo2 "country", ren2 "person") could be tokenized as 
    爱国 / 人, "country-loving person" or as 爱 / 国人, "love country-person."

Singular Value Decomposition or SVD: 
The words that appear most frequently in one topic would appear 
less frequently in the other, otherwise that word wouldn't make a good choice to separate out the two topics. 
Therefore, the Topics are Orthogonal. The SVD algorithm factorizes a matrix into one matrix with orthogonal 
columns and one with orthogonal rows along with diagonal matrix which contains the relative importance of each factor.

NonNegative Matrix Factorization or NMF: 
Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a factorization or constrain of non negative dataset. NMF is non exact 
factorization that factors into one short positive matrix.

Topic Frequency Inverse Document Frequency or TFIDF: 
TFIDF is a way to normalize the term counts by taking into account how often they appear in a document and how long the 
document is and how common or rare the document is.
